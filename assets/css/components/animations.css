   SCROLL REVEAL ANIMATIONS (IntersectionObserver-driven)

   🎓 THE CSS + JAVASCRIPT PARTNERSHIP:
   The JavaScript IntersectionObserver (in main.js) adds classes when elements
   enter the viewport. CSS handles the actual animation via transitions.

   This separation of concerns is powerful:
   - JS: "When should the animation start?" (viewport detection)
   - CSS: "How should the animation look?" (visual effects)

   📐 THE PATTERN:
   1. Elements start with opacity: 0 and transform: translateY(30px)
   2. JavaScript adds .visible class when element enters viewport
   3. CSS transitions smoothly animate to opacity: 1 and translateY(0)

   ⚡ PERFORMANCE NOTE:
   We ONLY animate `transform` and `opacity` because these properties:
   - Don't trigger layout recalculation (expensive!)
   - Don't trigger repaint (also expensive!)
   - Run on the GPU compositor thread (fast! 60fps!)

   NEVER animate: width, height, margin, padding, top, left, etc.
   These trigger layout and will cause jank (stuttering).

   STAGGERED REVEAL ANIMATION

   🎓 WHAT IS STAGGERING?
   Staggering means animating children elements one after another instead of
   all at once. This creates a "cascade" or "wave" effect that draws the eye
   and feels more dynamic than everything appearing simultaneously.

   📐 HOW IT WORKS:
   1. Parent has [data-reveal-stagger] attribute
   2. All children start invisible (opacity: 0, translateY)
   3. When parent gets .revealed class, children animate with increasing delays
   4. transition-delay creates the stagger: 0.1s, 0.2s, 0.3s, etc.

   💡 DATA ATTRIBUTES:
   We use data-* attributes instead of classes because:
   - They're semantic: "this element reveals with stagger"
   - They can hold values: data-stagger-delay="0.2s" (future enhancement)
   - They're easily queryable: [data-reveal-stagger]
   -------------------------------------------------------------------------- */
[data-reveal-stagger] > * {
	opacity: 0;
	transform: translateY(20px);
	transition: opacity 0.5s var(--ease-out),
	            transform 0.5s var(--ease-out);
}

/*
 * STAGGER DELAYS USING :nth-child
 *
 * Each child gets a progressively longer delay.
 * Child 1: 0.1s delay, Child 2: 0.2s delay, etc.
 *
 * This creates the "wave" effect as elements appear one by one.
 *
 * ⚠️ LIMITATION: This only works for up to 6 children. For dynamic
 * content with unknown child count, you'd need JavaScript to set delays.

   ACCESSIBILITY: REDUCED MOTION

   🎓 WHY THIS MATTERS:
   Some users experience motion sickness, vestibular disorders, or seizures
   triggered by animations. Others simply find motion distracting.

   The `prefers-reduced-motion` media query respects user preferences set in
   their operating system settings:
   - macOS: System Preferences → Accessibility → Display → Reduce motion
   - Windows: Settings → Ease of Access → Display → Show animations
   - iOS: Settings → Accessibility → Motion → Reduce Motion

   ⚖️ LEGAL REQUIREMENT:
   WCAG 2.1 Success Criterion 2.3.3 requires respecting user motion preferences.
   Ignoring this can expose you to accessibility lawsuits.

   📐 OUR APPROACH:
   When reduced motion is preferred, we:
   1. Disable ALL animations and transitions (near-instant 0.01ms)
   2. Make animated elements immediately visible (no waiting)
   3. Disable smooth scrolling (instant jumps instead)

   💡 WHY 0.01ms INSTEAD OF 0ms?
   Some browsers have bugs with 0ms duration. 0.01ms is effectively instant
   but avoids those edge cases.
