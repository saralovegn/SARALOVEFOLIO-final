# Project Inspiration

## Trends

- Dark mode portfolios — Using dark interfaces to give visual prominence to content and reduce distractions.
- Interactive micro-animations — Subtle motion (hover effects, scroll reveals, parallax) to guide the user and suggest interactivity.
- Experimental hero sections — Creative, expressive hero areas that set the tone of the portfolio and communicate personality from the first impression.

Its dark base and glowing accent influenced the overall aesthetic of the portfolio: a dark interface with soft highlights, light effects, and a focus on contrast and texture.

## Theme Draft

The core concept of this project is to create a portfolio that feels immersive, expressive, and personal, while remaining clear and functional.

I have always been drawn to nighttime. It soothes me, makes the world feel quieter, and creates a space where I can relax, reflect, and think about my ideas and dreams. That sense of stillness and focus was a key inspiration for the visual direction of this portfolio.

The dark mode design reflects that calm, nocturnal atmosphere, acting as a neutral stage where projects can stand out without visual noise. Floating elements, soft motion, and glowing accents are used to evoke a subtle sense of space and suspension, reinforcing a feeling of flow and concentration.

Overall, the goal was to recreate a cozy, focused, and slightly magical flow state, where the viewer can explore the work without distractions, while also getting a sense of my personal visual identity and creative mindset.
