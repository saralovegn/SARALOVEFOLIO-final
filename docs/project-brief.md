## Project Concept

### What are you building?

I am building a personal portfolio website that showcases my projects and skills in a visually impactful way. The site emphasizes a clean, modern design with dark mode, animations, and interactive elements.

### Who is it for?

This portfolio is aimed at potential employers, collaborators, and an international audience, particularly English-speaking users interested in my work.

### Why does it matter?

The portfolio serves as a professional showcase of my projects, design sensibilities, and technical skills. It highlights my ability to customize templates, create interactive features, and maintain a cohesive visual identity.

## Design Direction

### Visual Style

The design is visually rich, focusing on dark mode with accent colors, interactive hover effects, and subtle animations to enhance engagement. Each section is intended to be immersive and visually striking.

### Color Palette

--color-bg: #131313;            /* as the base gives the site a true dark foundation. */
--color-bg-alt: #242424;        /* adds depth and visual separation for sections, cards, or hoverable elements. */
--color-text: #f5f5f5;          /* creates hierarchy — primary content stands out, secondary content recedes. */
--color-text-muted: #ffe2f1;    /* creates hierarchy — primary content stands out, secondary content recedes. */
--color-accent: #ffa1d0;        /* draw attention to interactive elements like buttons and links. */
--color-accent-hover: #ff47a3;  /* draws even more attention to now click on interactive elements like buttons. */
