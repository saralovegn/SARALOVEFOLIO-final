## Project Concept

### What are you building?

I am building a personal portfolio website that showcases my projects and skills in a visually impactful way. The site emphasizes a clean, modern design with dark mode, animations, and interactive elements.

### Who is it for?

This portfolio is aimed at potential employers, collaborators, and an international audience, particularly English-speaking users interested in my work.

### Why does it matter?

The portfolio serves as a professional showcase of my projects, design sensibilities, and technical skills. It highlights my ability to customize templates, create interactive features, and maintain a cohesive visual identity.

## Design Direction

### Visual Style

The design is visually rich, focusing on dark mode with accent colors, interactive hover effects, and subtle animations to enhance engagement. Each section is intended to be immersive and visually striking.

### Color Palette

--color-bg: #131313;            /* as the base gives the site a true dark foundation. */
--color-bg-alt: #242424;        /* adds depth and visual separation for sections, cards, or hoverable elements. */
--color-text: #f5f5f5;          /* creates hierarchy — primary content stands out, secondary content recedes. */
--color-text-muted: #ffe2f1;    /* creates hierarchy — primary content stands out, secondary content recedes. */
--color-accent: #ffa1d0;        /* draw attention to interactive elements like buttons and links. */
--color-accent-hover: #ff47a3;  /* draws even more attention to now click on interactive elements like buttons. */

### Typography

Display font: Zalando Sans Expanded (headings, logo, hero text)
Body font: Helvetica Neue (paragraphs, UI elements)
Monospace: Ubuntu Mono (specific use cases)

## Reflection Questions

### What excites you most about this project?

What excites me the most about this project is that I am going to be able to create my own websites. Little by little I am understanding the world of coding. There are still a lot of things I do not understand and thanks to copilot, the problems I face get resolved and I learn from the editing it made in my code. 

### What challenges do you anticipate?

I am excited to work on my future organization. I learned that in this line of work, organizastion is key, having a structure and hirarchy. I believe my organization in this repo could have been better. 

### How does this project connect to your learning goals?

This project directly connects to my learning goals by helping me build confidence in writing and understanding code. It allows me to practice structuring real projects, experimenting with layout, animations, and responsive design, and learning how to debug and improve my work over time.
